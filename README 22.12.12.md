# Single Nucleotide Polymorphism(SNP)
This project retrieved the data from UniProt containing the records of genetic variations, SNPs. 
In this small class project, we try to make use of the relational database and apply Apriori Algoritm on the database in obtaining the frequent item set... In this case, what is the most frequent Amino Acid to change in the human Genome. In addition, we will observe that given the frequent item set in C_2 c, we will check for a given subset C_1 in c , whether or not the probability that c\C_1 will occur given C_1 occur....
